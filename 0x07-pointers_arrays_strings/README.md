this is the project about more or a deeper dive into the pointers and arrays subject.

we start with a function that fills a memory with a constant byte

then we move to another that cooies memory area

then another that locates a character in a string

the that gets the length of a prefix substring

then that searches a string for any of a set of bytes

then that locates a substring

then that prints a chess board

then that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a squre mattrix of integers

then that sets a value of a pointer to a char

 finally we create a file that contains a password of crackme2 executable.
